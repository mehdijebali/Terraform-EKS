# Provision EKS Cluster with Terraform
In this demo, we will deploy an AWS EKS Cluster. 
## About EKS
AWS EKS deploys and manages K8s cluster with easy and quickly set-up. So we get rid of complex configuration of K8s cluster. 
Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure across multiple AWS Availability Zones, so we don't need to maintain K8s Control Plane.

The infrastructure running on Amazon EKS is secure by default by setting up a secure and encrypted communication channel between worker nodes & Kubernetes endpoint.

Applications managed by Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications managed by any standard K8s environment.
